1. I need to figure out how to implement the Game class so that it's able to pause and wait for input during the selection phase.
2. I need to figure out best practices for web socket connections and message passing, so that I can get the server (particularly the game class) to connect to the client
3. I need to figure out how to make the game feel good on the client side. Good interactions, good accessibility, etc.
4. I need to figure out how to implement cards in a way that will require minimal code on the server side. Ideally, you could turn a database row into a fully-functioning with next to zero code.
